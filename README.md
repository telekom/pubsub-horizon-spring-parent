## Overview

This repository provides spring starter library that provides common functionality and models used by all [Horizon](https://github.com/telekom/pubsub-horizon) components. 
Basically it is a spring-boot-starter which provides some autoconfigurations for common tasks across the spring-boot components.

* HorizonAutoConfiguration:
  * HorizonMetricsHelperAutoConfiguration
  * HorizonTracerAutoConfiguration
  * CacheAutoConfiguration
  * MongoAutoConfiguration
  * KafkaAutoConfiguration
* KubernetesClientAutoConfiguration

Additionally, the horizon-spring-parent contains a core project with different classes and interfaces as well as constants 
for topics in the area of caching (hazelcast), kafka, kubernetes, metrics, tracing and logging.

## Building the library

This project uses gradle as build tool.

To build the project, run the following command:  
```
./gradlew clean build
```

## Using the library

Add the following to your `build.gradle`:  
```
def horizonParentVersion = '1.0.0'

dependencies {
  implementation "de.telekom.eni:horizon-spring-boot-starter:${horizonParentVersion}"
}
```

This library will provide an autoconfigured `HorizonTracer` bean that you can use in order to do tracing in an Horizon component.

### Configuration parameters

```yaml

pandora:
  tracing:

```

#### Special configurations

* If a `spring.profiles.active` is set with 'dev' or 'test', the kubernetes client will be configured using a configuration 
  file with the static path `KUBERNETES_DEV_CONFIG_FILE_PATH=kubernetes/config/config.laptop-dev-dev-system`
* Within tracing all horizon pubsub components appear under a common service name `pandora.tracing.name` in the tracing 
  system. This is useful to identify the service in the tracing system. The actual component name in the trace is also marked 
  in the span as tag `component`. All pubsub components use the value `horizon`.
